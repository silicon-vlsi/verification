# Layout (L-Edit)
* When opening the Layout for the first time, you need to select a **Top Library** which ideally should be the parent library of the cell you are editing.
* To setup the **Technology** reference to L-Edit (setup for one time only): 
    * Select ''Setup -> Technology Reference'' which will open a dialogbox:
    * Drop down **OpenAccess attached Library** for //Technology Reference// and
    * choose **TECH_XT018** and move it to //Attached library// pane.
* To check if it was read properly, on the left pane where you browse the Library, click on the ''Layer Palette'' tab and make sure you can see all layers and their corresponding //numbers//.
